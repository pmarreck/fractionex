# fractionex

Initial implementation of fractional math in Elixir using bignums to get infinite precision.

Overrides infix operators so you can work with fractions like you would with integers or floats.

Still needs a Struct implementation though- started out with a tagged tuple, basically.

VERY much a WIP currently! And I believe there are already libraries that do this better, but I wanted to try my hand at it as a learning experience.
